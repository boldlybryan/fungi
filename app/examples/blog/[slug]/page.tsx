      <h2>Welcome to Fungi</h2>
      <p>Fungi is a revolutionary platform that enables non-technical users to create working prototypes using natural language. This guide will help you get started.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 1: Sign Up</h3>
      <p>Create your free account in seconds. No credit card required.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Describe Your Idea</h3>
      <p>Simply describe what you want to build in plain English. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Add a contact form to the landing page"</li>
        <li>"Create a blog with grid layout"</li>
        <li>"Add a dark mode toggle"</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 3: Iterate with AI</h3>
      <p>Chat with our AI assistant to refine your prototype. Make changes, try new ideas, and see results instantly.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 4: Submit for Review</h3>
      <p>When you're happy with your prototype, submit it as a Pull Request for your team to review.</p>

      <h2>Maximize Your Prototyping Success</h2>
      <p>Here are some best practices we've learned from thousands of successful prototypes.</p>
      
      <h3>Be Specific</h3>
      <p>The more specific you are in your descriptions, the better results you'll get. Instead of "make it better", try "add more spacing between sections and use a softer color scheme".</p>
      
      <h3>Iterate Incrementally</h3>
      <p>Make small changes one at a time rather than requesting everything at once. This makes it easier to track what works and what doesn't.</p>
      
      <h3>Use Visual References</h3>
      <p>If you have examples of what you want, describe them in detail. "Like the hero section on Apple.com" is more helpful than "make it look modern".</p>

      <h2>From Idea to Launch in 24 Hours</h2>
      <p>This is the story of how one startup used Fungi to rapidly prototype and launch their product landing page.</p>
      
      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>The team needed to validate their product idea quickly with a professional landing page, but they didn't have a designer or frontend developer available.</p>
      
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>Using Fungi, they described their vision: "A modern SaaS landing page with a hero section, feature cards, pricing table, and contact form."</p>
      
      <h3>The Results</h3>
      <p>Within hours, they had a working prototype. After a few iterations with the AI assistant, they had exactly what they needed and were able to launch the same day.</p>

      <h2>Working Effectively with AI Assistants</h2>
      <p>Understanding how to communicate with AI can dramatically improve your results.</p>
      
      <h3>Think in Steps</h3>
      <p>Break down complex changes into smaller steps. This helps the AI understand exactly what you want.</p>
      
      <h3>Provide Context</h3>
      <p>Explain why you want something changed. This helps the AI make better decisions about implementation details.</p>
      
      <h3>Give Feedback</h3>
      <p>If something isn't quite right, explain what you'd like to be different. The AI learns from your feedback.</p>
